						<h3>Welcome to MiniFest: FallFest 1.16 from ModFest!</h3>
						<p>
							FallFest 1.16 is a modding event that will run from Thursday, October 1st thru Thursday,
							October 15th,
							2020. Like all ModFest modding events, FallFest is a great excuse to try something new,
							practice your modding abilities, get starting on a new mod you've been
							thinking about, or any other reason to make a mod.
						</p>
						<p>
							ModFest regularly runs modding events for each major Minecraft version, but 'MiniFest'
							events are slightly different. While the main ModFest modding events are open enough to allow
							essentially any mod in that follows the rules, MiniFest events require you to meet
							additional criteria, usually revolving around a specific theme. This time around, the theme
							is Fall/Halloween.
						</p>
						<p>
							FallFest will be much more display-oriented than previous ModFest events. The showcase
							server will have the theme of a fall/Halloween festival, and
							players can participate in fun minigames, events, and battles, while finding collectables,
							hanging out, and getting lost in mazes. While ModFest's end goal has always been about
							creating more mods, we would ask that for this one, you also consider how your mod could be
							used to make the FallFest showcase server a fun place to play on. Consider mechanics for
							minigames and other things that players could interact with when on the server.
						</p>
						<h3>Entry requirements:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Runs on Minecraft 1.16.3 with Fabric Loader.</li>
							<li>Cannot cause massive compatibility issues with other entries</li>
							<li>Mods must be created for this event in the allotted time period. This begins on the
								first second of October 1st UTC, and ends on the very last second of October 15th UTC.
							</li>
							<li>Use of one of the themes is <b>required</b>. Not doing so will result in
								disqualification. Themes are listed below.</li>
							<li>All team members must be present in the <a href="https://discord.gg/gn543Ee"
									target="_blank">ModFest Discord Server</a></li>
							<li>
								Using pre-created libraries, assets, or code is fine if they were not made specifically
								for your entry. The following are some acceptable use cases (but not all):
								<ul>
									<li>Using a library you or someone else made as long as it wasn't made with the
										intention of using it for your ModFest entry</li>
									<li>Using public domain assets or assets you made in the past that were not made
										specifically for your ModFest entry</li>
									<li>Using open source code (of yours or someone else) that was not made specifically
										for your ModFest entry</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>You can work:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>By yourself</li>
							<li>With a team of your choosing</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Themes:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Fall/Autumn</li>
							<li>Halloween</li>
							<li>Server Utilitiesâ€”i.e. utilities for boss arenas, modifiable spawners, mechanics for
								mazes, server welcome messages, etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Awards:</h3>
						<p>
							ModFest awards are just for fun and ModFest is not a highly competitive event. The ultimate
							goal of the event is simple: to make mods and have a good time doing it. If you stress about
							the awards the whole time, you probably won't have as much fun.
						</p>
						<h3>Where can I sign up?</h3>
						<p>
							Unlike past ModFest events, we aren't doing sign ups! Just make your mod within the time and
							submit it at the end via our Discord server (more instructions on how that works will come
							later, make sure to join our Discord server for updates).
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, definitely come check out our Discord server if you want to see previews of the mods
							people are working on or are just curious about ModFest in general. Feel free to chat, lurk,
							ask questions, or participate in FallFest 1.16.
